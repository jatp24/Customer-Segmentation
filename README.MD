# Customer Segments for Arvato Finance Solution <br>
The purpose of this project is to investigate two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. YI will be looking at the relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained. We will be to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. <br> <br>

## Motivation <br>
 To work with real-life data provided to us by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. <br>
